//! The methods in this file implement a "queryable" form for logging the outcomes of transactions.
//!
//! Each processed transaction should be logged if it succeeds, logged if it fails with an error,
//! and should be logged each time it is skipped.
//!
//! This way, when debugging a miner, we can run a standard query, and see what happened to the
//! transaction.
