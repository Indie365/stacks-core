 * The `StackAggregationCommitIndexedSigCommand` allows an operator to

 * slot.

 * in multiple transactions, so long as:
 *  1. The pox-addr is the same.
 *  2. The "commit" transaction is called _before_ the PoX anchor block.
 *
 * This command calls `stack-aggregation-commit-indexed` using a
 * `signature`.
 *
 * Constraints for running this command include:
 * - The Operator must have locked STX on behalf of at least one stacker.
 * - The total amount previously locked by the Operator on behalf of the
 *   stackers has to be greater than the uSTX threshold.
