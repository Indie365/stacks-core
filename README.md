Blockstack is a new decentralized web, where users own their data and apps run on user devices without the need for hosting. Developers can build
serverless apps without the need to trust any centralized services or infrastructure.

For more info on Blockstack see: http://github.com/blockstack/blockstack

**Blockstack Core is the reference implementation of Blockstack.** It is responsible for processing blockchain transactions, creating virtualchain state, and building the peer network amongst other things. Blockstack Core provides a RESTful interface for clients and also comes with a command-line-interface (CLI).
